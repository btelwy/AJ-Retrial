FOREWORD

Hey, thanks for downloading this soundfont! I poured lots of
effort, heart and soul into making it. This allows for 100%
flawless recreation of Apollo Justice's music with no missing
instruments!

This soundfont is optimized for use with FL Studio. You can use
it with other audio workstations, but I can't guarantee that it
will work. This soundfont is also not to be sold or distributed
for any sort of monetary gain. If you obtained this soundfont
through a purchase, I strongly recommend that you get a prompt
refund!

The instruments used in this soundfont are the respective property
of Capcom or the original source. They do not belong to you, me,
or your creepy neighbor Harry down the street.

UPDATE HISTORY

2.0 (11/8/2019) This update took a lot of tedious work.
-Named all samples/presets according to their filenames. Should
now correctly reflect the selected instrument.

-Renamed Cln. Guitar & Strings to Clean Guit. & Strings.

-Renamed Nylon Str. Guitar 1 and 2 to Nylon Guitar 1 and 2.

-Renamed Toms to Tom.

-Removed several unnecessary instruments from the single soundfont.

-Created a single soundfont containing all instrument patches for
those of you who can't figure out how to use separate ones.
Separate soundfonts are in a marked side folder now.





Make some noise.
