(Bzzzzzzzt)

OFFICER:
Mr. Edgeworth, you have a visitor!
EDGEWORTH:
I have a feeling I know who it is. Send him in.


GUMSHOE:
Good afternoon, Mr. Edgeworth!
EDGEWORTH:
Good afternoon, Detective. What brings you to my office? Again.
GUMSHOE:
Well... Er... There's something I'd like to show you, sir.
EDGEWORTH:
Is it related to that evidence I asked you to look into?
GUMSHOE:
No, sir. It's a letter.
EDGEWORTH:
A letter? From whom?
GUMSHOE:
...I think you should read it yourself.
EDGEWORTH:
(What could this be?)
Meet me at the Wright & Co. Law Offices tonight at 5 PM. I want to catch up. Make sure you bring "him" too.
Signed, Phoenix Wright
?!

(Fade to black)

EDGEWORTH:
(The last time I heard from Wright was about a year ago. We had kept in contact with one another for a while, but suddenly, he disappeared. I've been trying to reach out to him for all this time. I've called and sent letters, each with no response. Why would he reach out now of all times? And to Detective Gumshoe, of all people?!)

(Fade in)

GUMSHOE:
What're we gonna do, sir?
EDGEWORTH:
Isn't it obvious? We'll accept his request. Do you have any objections?
GUMSHOE:
Of course not! Let's go, sir!

Date: ???
Wright & Co. Law Offices

(EDGEWORTH and GUMSHOE arrive at the WRIGHT & CO. LAW OFFICES, or at least what was the Wright & Co Law Offices. The place is a mess. Papers are strewn everywhere, trinkets litter the ground, and what appears to be equipment for a magic show is tucked in a corner.)

EDGEWORTH:
What the— Are you sure this is the right place?
GUMSHOE:
That's what the address book said, sir.
EDGEWORTH:
This office used to look presentable, at the least. Now it bears resemblance to your apartment, Detective.
GUMSHOE:
...! C-c'mon, sir! It's not that bad.
EDGEWORTH:
(I beg to differ.)
???:
You know it's rude to speak about people in their presence.
EDGEWORTH:
!
GUMSHOE:
M-M... Mr. Wright!

(PHOENIX WRIGHT enters the scene. He’s in his usual “Hobo Nick” attire, complete with an unshaven face and a gray jacket.)

PHOENIX:
Good evening, Detective. And to you as well, Mr. Edgeworth.
EDGEWORTH:
Hello to you too, Wright.
PHOENIX:
What's with the cold welcome? I figured you'd be itching to see me.
EDGEWORTH:
Make no mistake, I am glad to see you. But there are... other things that are on my mind.
PHOENIX:
Oh really? Such as?
EDGEWORTH:
(Where do I even begin?!)
Well... You've... redecorated.
PHOENIX:
Ah ha ha, yes. You can thank Trucy for that. She needed room to practice her magic, and this is how it ended up.
GUMSHOE:
Aww... That's nice, pal. I've been trying to get Mr. Edgeworth to come to one of her shows. But he doesn't wan—
EDGEWORTH:
But my schedule's been tight. I'm in the running for the next district Chief Prosecutor. I can't afford to slack off and see amateur magic acts.
PHOENIX:
I'm telling you, she's no amateur. I would have her show you some tricks, but she's asleep right now. 
Though that plate of spaghetti should be all you need to see she's the real deal.
EDGEWORTH:
What plate of— O-oh!
(How in the world is that fork levitating?! There must be some sort of string—)
PHOENIX:
Nothing's holding it up. I've been trying to figure that trick out for years and gotten nowhere. Maybe you could use that “Logic” you're so proud of to figure it out.
EDGEWORTH:
(Did Wright learn to read minds over the last year?!)
PHOENIX:
Maybe I did, maybe I didn't.
EDGEWORTH:
(What!? How!? Am I dreaming!? Surely not!)
(Very well then. The first step is to regain my composure...)
...I need to step out for a moment.
PHOENIX:
Eh? What was that, Edgeworth?
EDGEWORTH:
(Ngooh! Wright is one move ahead of me, it seems.)
(Next plan: act like nothing is wrong, and solve this mystery later.)
Nothing, Wright. What else have you been getting up to? Besides harboring a magician.
PHOENIX:
Well... I started working at a small jazz club as a pianist. I need to start practicing more songs, though. I can only play one.
EDGEWORTH:
Oh, really? What song?
PHOENIX:
Man of the Piano by William John.
EDGEWORTH:
(I've seen experts struggle with that song. Wright must be quite talented.)
PHOENIX:
I also decided to take after the Detective and get a jacket. I think it fits with the beanie.
GUMSHOE:
Hey, pal! This coat was handcrafted by Maggey! Not something bought at a thrift store!
PHOENIX:
A place I'm sure you’re familiar with.
GUMSHOE:
Not anymore, pal! Mr. Edgeworth's given me plenty of salary raises!
PHOENIX:
Really! It only took over ten years.
EDGEWORTH:
Again with the jabs, Wright?
PHOENIX:
Relax, Edgeworth. You don't need any more wrinkles on your forehead.
EDGEWORTH:
...What's happened to you?
PHOENIX:
Huh? Where'd that come from?
EDGEWORTH:
You've changed, Wright. I remember when you always looked on the bright side. Trying to find the best out of desperate situations.
But now... you've grown cold. Even your smile lacks its customary warmth.
PHOENIX:
...Heh.
GUMSHOE:
What're you laughing at, pal!? Mr. Edgeworth's pouring his heart out to you!
PHOENIX:
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Just... That's rich coming from you, Edgeworth.
EDGEWORTH:
!
PHOENIX:
I never thought I'd be lectured about attitude by the moodiest person on Earth.
I guess my life has some surprises left.
EDGEWORTH:
You're acting like a completely different person! What could've possibly happened to spark such a change?
PHOENIX:
You really want to know?
GUMSHOE:
'Course, pal! I want to help you, and I know Mr. Edgeworth does too.
PHOENIX:
Thanks, Detective Gumshoe.
The truth is... life happened.
GUMSHOE:
...
EDGEWORTH:
...That's it?
PHOENIX:
That's the truth, Edgeworth.
EDGEWORTH:
Wright, it’s been nearly three years since that trial.
I've known of your disbarment for ages.
PHOENIX:
Yes, Edgeworth. You have. But that's just it. I’ve spent the past three years trying to raise a daughter.
With a little help, I've kept the lights on and Trucy fed. But it hasn't been easy. 
It was devastating walking around town every day, seeing people who looked up to me.
Quickly, rumors broke out. Small things, but there was enough truth in them that I had to do something about it.
So I decided to ditch the blue suit and leave myself behind.
EDGEWORTH:
...
PHOENIX:
Once people stopped recognizing me, I knew my ruse had worked.
That's the truth. I'm doing everything I can, every day, every night.
But I'm not "Mr. Wright" anymore. Just "Phoenix."
An ordinary guy, like always. But one who can barely protect his own daughter.
Sure, you know "of" my disbarment. But you'll never, ever know "about" it.
Not while you work in that cushy little office of yours.
EDGEWORTH:
W-Wright, I... I had no idea.
PHOENIX:
I'm... I'm sorry. It all came out, all of a sudden.
Three years of "if only I could do more."
"If only I were me."
I meant it... but you have to understand, I also didn't.
GUMSHOE:
No problem, pal!
EDGEWORTH:
Very well, Wright. I understand.
While it is true that I am tempted to reprimand you for disappearing...
I have the impression that I did something similar, once.
PHOENIX:
So you did.
EDGEWOTH:
Indeed. Life happens, and so do matters of emotion.
Then you are forgiven. Now never do it again, do you hear me?
PHOENIX:
Loud and clear, Edgeworth.
GUMSHOE:
So what're you going to do now, pal?
PHOENIX:
Honestly, I don't know. I've been content with letting the winds of life carry me wheresoever they choose.
GUMSHOE:
C'mon, pal! You have to do something!
PHOENIX:
I'm doing all I can. But I'm a civilian now.
I don't have access to any information related to the case, except for some personal records.
I'm investigating thoroughly, but as long as I'm a civilian...
...and as long as I'm a father, I have other priorities.
To see Trucy smile.
I want to be "Mr. Wright, attorney at law" again. I really do.
But deep down, I know her smile is more radiant than any badge.
And her calling me "Daddy"... is the most fulfilling title I could ever hope for.
GUMSHOE:
Aww, y-you're gonna make me tear up, here!
*sniff* *sob* *bawl*
EDGEWORTH:
(Wright does have a point.)
Wha— Detective! Why are you looking at me like that?! Clean up those tears!
You look like a starved dog.
GUMSHOE:
O-Oh! S-Sorry, s-sir!
PHOENIX:
The good detective must want you to pull in a favor for me.
EDGEWORTH:
I figured as much. You can rest easy, Detective. I already planned to reopen the investigation.
I'm unsure if any new information will surface, but it's worth trying.
PHOENIX:
I— Thanks, Edgeworth.
EDGEWORTH:
No need to remain so stoic, Wright.
PHOENIX:
Practice what you preach.

(The two share a laugh.)

(Fade to black.)
EDGEWORTH:
(Phoenix Wright. I'll never know what goes on inside that head of yours. But ever since I met you, I've learned that things have a way of working out for the best. Hopefully, once this nightmare is over, we'll be able to do battle in court again.)
