Apollo's Apartment

{sound:door}
{name:apollo}
Home sweet home. Well, that's what they say, anyway.
Feels like a lie right now. Not your fault, though, apartment. Everything does.

Surprised I didn't crash my bike riding over here. I was squeezing that thing like a vise.
Would've been the cherry on top of the mess I'd always dreamed would be a cake.

Alright, here's the plan. I lie down, and when I wake up...
(...when I wake up, maybe the pit in my chest will be gone. Maybe I can still dream.)

(he lies down)

...
{name:apollo}
(Maybe I should call Clay. He'd know what to do… but…)
(...geez, I'm zonked out.)

...

(there's a ringing noise)

{name:apollo}
(His telepathy strikes again.)

(phone is answered)

{name:clay}
Heya Pollo, what's down? I really wanted to call earlier to check in about how it went, but Director Cosmos needed some help with one of the robots, well, uh, still needs, ‘cuz I sorta dropped ten screws inside it. So he said—

{name:apollo}
Whoa, whoa, hold up there! Can't I get a word or two in?

{name:clay}
Ha ha ha, forgot myself again, Pollo. My bad, my bad.

{name:apollo}
“My bad” my behind. We both know perfectly well that you do it just to be annoying.

{name:clay}
Then it sounds like it's doing its job! Unlike me!

{name:apollo}
(I can just imagine his sheepish grin. And... oh, darn it, now I'm smiling too.)
And we both know perfectly well that you ace your job, so no need to make fun of yourself for my sake.
I mean, how long until you go into space? December of next year?

{name:clay}
Yep, just about eighteen months from now.
But no joke, Pollo, I gotta tell you the rest of this story, it's pretty epic.

{name:apollo}
Fine, fine.

{name:clay}
So, look, Director Cosmos has this huge drawer of screws that only he can tell apart.
And, I mean, he did document which is which, but he did it on paper.
In this day and age! And his handwriting looks like that time I made you do your math homework blindfolded!
How could I have known which one to use? How in the ever-expanding universe could I have known, Pollo?

{name:apollo}
Allow me to translate: "I grabbed them all at once to figure out which one fit."
"Shockingly, I was unable to hold seventy-two screws."

{name:clay}
Hey, efficiency is proficiency. It's just that I didn't expect gravity to betray me like that. 
I swear, this is why I'm going to space.

{name:apollo}
More like your brain betrayed you. Are you getting a new one in space?

{name:clay}
Who knows? The possibilities are endless.
More importantly, how did it go today?
One more time, I'm so sorry I couldn't be there. I just can't miss training.

{name:apollp}
Honestly, I'm glad you weren't there.

{name:clay}
Something wrong, Pollo?

{name:apollo}
Yeah... speaking of "betraying."

{name:clay}
Huh?

{name:apollo}
What if I tell you that...
That the two people I looked up to the most of anyone betrayed me today?
That Mr. Wright gave me forged evidence that could have gotten me disbarred?
That the rumors about him forging evidence in his last trial are probably true?

{name:clay}
...

{name:apollo}
What if I tell you that I lost my job and all of my trust in the people I trusted most?
That I was so furious I punched Mr. Wright in the face?
That... that...
That in my very first trial, Mr. Gavin turned out to be a real, live murderer?!

{name:clay}
...
It's okay, Pollo. I'm here.

...

{name:apollo}
*sob* *sniff* *bawl* *sob*
(So much for staying cool.)
Sorry for losing it there. I didn't mean to take it out on you.

{name:clay}
Pollo... I can't believe they did that to you.
...
...

{name:apollo}
Clay?

{name:clay}
Sorry, I'm not mad. I mean, I'm furious, too. But not at you. For you.

{name:apollo}
For some reason, that actually makes me feel better. Thanks, Clay.

{name:clay}
No prob. Seriously, are you okay though?

{name:apollo}
You'd think after a few hours it would process...
But judging by my tears, I'd give it another week or so.

{name:clay}
And that's alright.

{name:apollo}
It isn't even the first time someone has betrayed my trust.
So why am I sad that it happened again?

{name:clay}
Because it's sad every time, Pollo. Life is pretty sad, isn't it?
That's why I'm here to brighten it up for you.

{name:apollo}
(I don't know where I'd be without you, Clay.)
And I'm here to remind you to be responsible, since you have a few screws loose.

{name:clay}
Yeah, that generally does happen when you drop them.
Changing subject.

{name:apollo}
Can you not think of any better transition?

{name:clay}
Nope.
What are you gonna do now that you're unemployed? Need any help?

{name:apollo}
Oh, I appreciate it, but luckily I have some emergency cash and... well, an offer...

{name:clay}
Nice, where's the offer at?

{name:apollo}
I don't think I'm ready to tell you, honestly. I've got to... think through some things first.
But I will. I promise.
(I'm just too ashamed to say it out loud.)

{name:clay}
Roger that.

{name:apollo}
Hey.

{name:clay}
Now what kind of transition is that?

{name:apollo}
You knew, didn't you? That the trial didn't go well.
Because if it had, I would've called you immediately.
That's why you started off with that story. To make me feel better.
I'm right, aren't I? You can admit it.

{name:clay}
I don't know, admitting that you're right? I'd rather take off my hat.
But uh, maybe. Yeah.
You're one smart cookie, Pollo.

{name:apollo}
Clay...
(What does being smart count for, really, when everything's falling apart?
What can all my studying even accomplish?)

{name:clay}
Apollo.
Our lives are just beginning. Our stories are just starting.
Whatever happens, wherever we go...
You'll be a star. I just know it.

{name:apollo}
And we'll be a binary system, right?

{name:clay}
Right. Two stars, connected in orbit by each other's gravity.
Because even in the depths of space, gravity can still reach.

{name:apollo}
...Then there's nothing left to do but shine.

{name:clay}
There's nothing left to do but shine!
Just like that badge pinned on your lapel.

{name:apollo}
You're right. I still have my badge.
I still have everything I've worked for.
And people to believe in?
Well, I'm still struggling with that.
But for now I have you, Clay, and that's enough.

{name:clay}
Bingo. Back at you.
I trust you, I believe in you, and, uh, I don't really think I've killed anyone.

{name:apollo}
Filling me with confidence here.

{name:clay}
And, uh, Pollo?

{name:apollo}
Yeah?

{name:clay}
You'll let me see Mr. Gavin in prison, won't you?
I'd love to slug him. You know, just bruise him up a teeny-tiny bit.
It's not fair that Mr. Wright gets all the attention.

{name:apollo}
I'm honored, but I'm not sure I could acquit you from that one.

{name:clay}
Nonsense.
Oops, gotta go, Pollo. Talk later, okay?

{name:apollo}
No problem. I should be off too.
After all... the world is waiting.
