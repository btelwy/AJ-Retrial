Borscht Bowl Club

Phoenix:
(Whew. Poker really takes it out of you when everyone wants to see you lose.)
(Of course I'm doing this all for Trucy, but that said...)
("Showdown time"? I'd prefer "chow-down time" right about now.)
(I hope he gets here soon.)

Kristoph:
Good evening, Wright.

Phoenix:
Ah, just in time, Kristoph. My match wrapped up a minute ago.

Kristoph:
And? Game go well?

Phoenix:
Naturally.
Especially if the guy screaming "I 
hope both sides of your pillow 
are warm!" is any indication.

Kristoph:
...An interesting choice of thing to wish ill on someone.
Regardless, some people are merely despicable riff-raff.
Pay them no heed.

Phoenix:
Yeah, I won't. Just tiring when the whole world is against you.
But more importantly, I'm starved. Want me to get us some dinner?

Kristoph:
No objections here.

Phoenix:
Then two bowls of borscht, coming up.

{spriteFade:out}

Phoenix:
(Let's see, two bowls of the Chef's Special borscht, as usual.)
(Here they are. Piping cold, just like both sides of my pillow.)

{spriteFade:in}

Phoenix:
Here we are.

Kristoph:
Much obliged.

Phoenix:
Bon appetit.
(Chow-down time.)

(pause as they eat)

Kristoph:
...Invigorating as always.

Phoenix:
You can admit you don't like borscht, you know.
We've been at this long enough.

Kristoph:
!

Phoenix:
Oh come on, I'm the "Undefeated Phoenix Wright."
Don't sell my poker skills that short. Of course I can tell.

Kristoph:
I admit, borscht does not quite agree with my sensitivities.
Nor does this... rather crude venue.

Phoenix:
I see. Then why do you schedule so many dinners here?

Kristoph:
It's because the company does.

(Three normal Psyche-Locks appear)

Phoenix:
(There they are. Again. They appear, over and over.)
(They always have, ever since we met seven years ago.)
(Why would he lie about the most mundane things, like why he scheduled dinner?)
(Kristoph... is my friend. I have the evidence through his actions.)
(I trust my friends. But after years of lies, I can't trust him.)
(Is he just a pathological liar? Is there a deeper reason?)
(It's the conclusion I come to, every time: "stay on guard.")
(Trucy and I would be safer away from him, I know.)
(But companionship is a bond, and I'm not someone with the strength to break it.)
(I'm weak. I'm bound.)

(Psyche-Locks disappear)

Phoenix:
You're going to make me blush, Kristoph.

Kristoph:
If your cheeks are reddening, I'd wager it's from this infernal chill.

Phoenix:
True, true.

Kristoph:
Speaking of which...

Phoenix:
Yes?

Kristoph:
I must bring it up again.
This work does not suit someone of your intellectual caliber, Wright.
Entertaining thugs with cards as you crystallize?
Would you not like to work at my office, perhaps as a legal aide?

Phoenix:
A ha ha ha, this again?
(I have to question why he keeps asking.)
I'm not an attorney anymore. I'm not qualified to practice law in any way.

Kristoph:
An administrative job, then? You could file papers.
Rest assured, even performing such a menial task, you'd receive double your current pay.

Phoenix:
An administrative legal job... That, I would be capable of doing.

Kristoph:
So you agree, then?

Phoenix:
But you're selling poker short again.
It may not be the most glamorous job, and it may not give me much beyond what I need to pay the bills.
Yet you of all people should understand it's quite like being in court.
It requires all of your deduction, observation, and acting abilities.

Kristoph:
By "acting" you mean "bluffing."
I have no need for bluffing. Bluffing is for those who are backed against a wall.

Phoenix:
It's not like I bluffed all that much, back in the day.
But it sure did come in handy whenever I did.

Kristoph:
...Regardless.
I too enjoy the thrilling stratagems of poker.
But you are undefeated. You have nothing to win and everything to lose.
Why not step away while you're ahead? Into a more comfortable position, at that.

Phoenix:
I appreciate your offer, Kristoph. I really do.
But for now, this shabby, run-down joint is where I belong.

Kristoph:
You're the most stubborn person I know, Wright.
...Say.
It's nearing the seven-year anniversary, isn't it?
Of when you were set up.

Phoenix:
Today's April 17, huh? So it is.

Kristoph:
You aren't still punishing yourself for that, are you?
For being careless. You couldn't have known.

Phoenix:
...
(I am. Every day. And I have to hide it from Trucy, too.)

Kristoph:
I am a firm believer that everyone makes mistakes.
You deserve a second chance, Wright.
Release the past, and come work for my office.

Phoenix:
I've been trying, Kristoph. But I haven't been able to let my past self go, yet.
I promised someone I wouldn't.

Kristoph:
How unfortunate. Keep my offer in mind, then, yes?

Phoenix:
Will do.
(pause)
Looks like we've both finished off our borscht.
Want me to take your bowl for you?

Kristoph:
Sincerest thanks.
Considering the late hour, I should get my repose.

Phoenix:
Wish I could, too. Old men like us need our beauty sleep.

(Kristoph disappears and then reappears)

Kristoph:
Ah, I forgot to ask about Miss Trucy. How is she?

Phoenix:
Moved schools again recently, but doing well.
Got a big show coming up on Wednesday.

Kristoph:
At the Wonder Bar, as usual?
My schedule is more relaxed this week, so it'd be my pleasure to attend.

Phoenix:
And I'm sure she'd love to have you there.

Kristoph:
Very well.
It's been a pleasant evening, Wright.
Until we meet again.

(screen fades to black)

Phoenix:
(And so he turned to leave, walking with that intentional stride of his.)
(Little did I know that within hours the curtain was about to close on our friendship...)
(...And rise on the next act of the play.)
(The cards were being dealt, and the game was just beginning in earnest.)
