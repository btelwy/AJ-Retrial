{name:officer}
Mr. Edgeworth,{wait:short} you have a visitor!{textboxEnd}

{name:edgeworth}
I have a feeling I know who{newLine}
it is.{wait:normal} Send him in.{textboxEnd}

{name:gumshoe}
Good afternoon,{wait:short} Mr. Edgeworth!{textboxEnd}

{name:edgeworth}
Good afternoon,{wait:short} Detective.{wait:normal}{newLine}
What brings you to my office?{wait:normal}{newLine}
Again.{textboxEnd}

{name:gumshoe}
Well...{wait:normal} Er...{textboxEnd}
There's something I'd like{newLine}
to show you,{wait:short} sir.{textboxEnd}

{name:edgeworth}
Is it related to that{newLine}
evidence I asked you to{newLine}
look into?{textboxEnd}

{name:gumshoe}
No,{wait:short} sir.{wait:normal}{newLine}
It's a letter.{textboxEnd}

{name:edgeworth}
A letter?{wait:normal} From whom?{textboxEnd}

{name:gumshoe}
...I think you should read it{newLine}
yourself.{textboxEnd}

{name:edgeworth}
{textColor:blue}
(What could this be?){textboxEnd}{textColor:green}
Meet me at the Wright & Co.{newLine}
Law Offices tonight at 5 PM.{textboxEnd}
I want to catch up.{wait:normal}{newLine}
Make sure you bring "him" too.{textboxEnd}
Signed,{wait:short}{newLine}
Phoenix Wright{textboxEnd}{textColor:white}

{name:edgeworth}{textColor:blue}
(The last time I heard from Wright{newLine}
was about a year ago.){textboxEnd}
(We had kept in contact for{newLine}
a while,{wait:short} but suddenly,{wait:short} he{newLine}
disappeared.){textboxEnd}
(I've been trying to reach out{newLine}
to him for all this time.){textboxEnd}
(I've called and sent letters,{wait:short}{newLine}
each with no response.){textboxEnd}
(Why would he reach out now{newLine}
of all times?{wait:normal} And to Detective{newLine}
Gumshoe,{wait:short} of all people!?){textboxEnd}{textColor:white}

{screenFadeIn:edgeworthOffice}

{name:gumshoe}
What're we gonna do,{wait:short} sir?{textboxEnd}

{name:edgeworth}
Isn't it obvious?{wait:normal}{newLine}
We'll accept his request.{textboxEnd}
Do you have any objections?{textboxEnd}

{name:gumshoe}
Of course not!{wait:normal} Let's go,{wait:short} sir!{textboxEnd}

What the--{newLine}
Are you sure this is the right{newLine}
place?{textboxEnd}

{screenFadeIn:waa}

{name:gumshoe}
That's what the address book said,{wait:short} sir.{textboxEnd}

{name:edgeworth}
This office used to look{newLine}
presentable,{wait:short} at the least.{textboxEnd}
Now it bears resemblance to{newLine}
your apartment,{wait:short} Detective.{textboxEnd}

{name:gumshoe}
...!{wait:normal}{newLine}
C-C'mon,{wait:short} sir!{wait:normal}{newLine}
It's not that bad.{textboxEnd}

{name:edgeworth}
{textColor:blue}(I beg to differ.){textboxEnd}{textColor:white}

about people in their presence.{textboxEnd}

!{sound:ding}{wait:short}{textboxEnd}

{name:gumshoe}
M-M...{wait:normal} Mr. Wright!{textboxEnd}

{name:phoenix}
Good evening,{wait:short} Detective.{wait:normal}{newLine}
And to you as well,{wait:short} Mr. Edgeworth.{textboxEnd}

{name:edgeworth}
Hello to you too,{wait:short} Wright.{textboxEnd}

{name:phoenix}
What's with the cold welcome?{wait:normal}{newLine}
I figured you'd be itching to{newLine}
see me.{textboxEnd}

{name:edgeworth}
Make no mistake,{wait:short} I am glad{newLine}
to see you.{wait:normal} But there are...{wait:normal}{newLine}
other things that are on my mind.{textboxEnd}

{name:phoenix}
Oh,{wait:short} really?{wait:normal} Such as?{textboxEnd}

{name:edgeworth}
{textColor:blue}(Where do I even begin!?){wait:normal}{newLine}{textColor:white}
Well...{wait:normal} You've...{wait:normal} redecorated.{textboxEnd}

{name:phoenix}
A ha ha,{wait:short} yes.{wait:normal}{newLine}
You can thank Trucy for that.{textboxEnd}
She needed room to practice{newLine}
her magic,{wait:short} and this is how it{newLine}
ended up.{textboxEnd}

{name:gumshoe}
Aww...{wait:normal} That's nice,{wait:short} pal.{textboxEnd}
I've been trying to get Mr. Edgeworth{newLine}
to come to one of her shows.{textboxEnd}
But he doesn't wan--{textboxEnd}

{name:edgeworth}
But my schedule's been tight.{textboxEnd}
I'm in the running for the{newLine}
next district Chief Prosecutor.{textboxEnd}
I can't afford to slack off{newLine}
and see amateur magic acts.{textboxEnd}

{name:phoenix}
I'm telling you,{wait:short} she's no amateur.{textboxEnd}
I would have her show you some{newLine}
tricks,{wait:short} but she's asleep right now.{textboxEnd}
Though that plate of spaghetti{newLine}
should be all you need to{newLine}
see she's the real deal.{textboxEnd}

{name:edgeworth}
What plate of--{wait:normal}
{sound:shock}O-Oh!{textboxEnd}{textColor:blue}
(How in the world is that{newLine}
fork levitating!?){textboxEnd}
(There must be some sort{newLine}
of string--){textboxEnd}{textColor:white}

{name:phoenix}
Nothing's holding it up.{textboxEnd}
I've been trying to figure that{newLine}
trick out for years and{newLine}
gotten nowhere.{textboxEnd}
Maybe you could use that "Logic"{newLine}
you're so proud of to{newLine}
figure it out.{textboxEnd}

{name:edgeworth}{textColor:blue}
(Did Wright learn to read minds{newLine}
over the last year!?){textboxEnd}
{textColor:white}

{name:phoenix}
Maybe I did,{wait:short} maybe I didn't.{textboxEnd}

{name:edgeworth}{textColor:blue}
(What!?{wait:normal} How!?{wait:normal}{newLine}
Am I dreaming!?{wait:normal} Surely not!){textboxEnd}
(Very well then.{wait:normal}{newLine}
The first step is to regain{newLine}
my composure...){textboxEnd}{textColor:white}
...I need to step out for{newLine}
a moment.{textboxEnd}

{name:phoenix}
Eh?{wait:normal} What was that,{wait:short} Edgeworth?{textboxEnd}

{name:edgeworth}{textColor:blue}
(Ngooh!{wait:normal} Wright is one move ahead{newLine}
of me,{wait:short} it seems.){textboxEnd}
(Change of plan:{wait:normal}{newLine}
act like nothing is wrong,{wait:short} and{newLine}
solve this mystery later.){textboxEnd}{textColor:white}
Nothing,{wait:short} Wright.{wait:normal} What else have{newLine}
you been getting up to?{textboxEnd}
Besides harboring a magician.{textboxEnd}

{name:phoenix}
Well...{wait:normal} I started working at a{newLine}
small jazz club as a pianist.{textboxEnd}
I need to start practicing more{newLine}
songs,{wait:short} though.{wait:normal} I can only{newLine}
play one.{textboxEnd}

{name:edgeworth}
Oh,{wait:short} really?{wait:normal} What song?{textboxEnd}

{name:phoenix}
{textColor:red}Man of the Piano{textColor:white} by William John.{textboxEnd}

{name:edgeworth}
(I've seen experts struggle with that song. Wright must be quite talented.)

{name:phoenix}
I also decided to take after the Detective and get a jacket.
I think it fits with the beanie.

{name:gumshoe}
Hey,{wait:short} pal! This coat was handcrafted by Maggey!
Not something bought at a thrift store!

{name:phoenix}
A place I'm sure you're familiar with.

{name:gumshoe}
Not anymore,{wait:short} pal! Mr. Edgeworth's given me plenty of salary raises!

{name:phoenix}
Really! It only took over ten years.

{name:edgeworth}
Again with the jabs,{wait:short} Wright?

{name:phoenix}
Relax,{wait:short} Edgeworth. You don't need any more wrinkles on your forehead.

{name:edgeworth}
...What's happened to you?

{name:phoenix}
Huh? Where'd that come from?

{name:edgeworth}
You've changed,{wait:short} Wright.
I remember when you always looked on the bright side.
Trying to find the best out of desperate situations.
But now... you've grown cold. Even your smile lacks its customary warmth.

{name:phoenix}
...Heh.

{name:gumshoe}
What're you laughing at,{wait:short} pal!? Mr. Edgeworth's pouring his heart out to you!

{name:phoenix}
I'm sorry,{wait:short} I'm sorry. Just... That's rich coming from you,{wait:short} Edgeworth.

{name:edgeworth}
!

{name:phoenix}
I never thought I'd be lectured about attitude by the moodiest person on Earth.
I guess my life has some surprises left.

{name:edgeworth}
You're acting like a completely different person!
What could've possibly happened to spark such a change?

{name:phoenix}
You really want to know?

{name:gumshoe}
'Course,{wait:short} pal! I want to help you,{wait:short} and I know Mr. Edgeworth does too.

{name:phoenix}
Thanks,{wait:short} Detective Gumshoe.
The truth is... life happened.

{name:gumshoe}
...

{name:edgeworth}
...That's it?

{name:phoenix}
That's the truth,{wait:short} Edgeworth.

{name:edgeworth}
Wright,{wait:short} it's been nearly three years since that trial.
I've known of your disbarment for ages.

{name:phoenix}
Yes,{wait:short} Edgeworth. You have. But that's just it.
I've spent the past three years trying to raise a daughter.
With a little help,{wait:short} I've kept the lights on and Trucy fed. But it hasn't been easy. 
It was devastating walking around town every day,{wait:short} seeing people who looked up to me.
Quickly,{wait:short} rumors broke out. Small things at first.
Yet there was enough truth in them that every gaze stung.
So I... decided to ditch the blue suit,{wait:short} bury that part of myself inside.

{name:edgeworth}
...

{name:phoenix}
Once people stopped recognizing me,{wait:short} I knew my ruse had worked.
That's the truth. I'm doing everything I can,{wait:short} every night,{wait:short} every day.
But I'm not "Mr. Wright" anymore. Just "Phoenix."
An ordinary guy,{wait:short} like he always was...
And now one who can barely even protect his own daughter.
What kind of life is that?
Sure,{wait:short} you know "of" my disbarment. But you'll never,{wait:short} ever know "about" it.

{name:edgeworth}
W-Wright,{wait:short} I... I had no idea.

{name:phoenix}
I'm... I'm sorry. It all came out,{wait:short} all of a sudden.
Three years of "if only I could do more."
"If only I could protect those I love."
"If only I could be me."
I meant what I said... but you have to understand,{wait:short} I also didn't.

{name:gumshoe}
No problem,{wait:short} pal!

{name:edgeworth}
Very well,{wait:short} Wright. I understand.
While it is true that I am tempted to reprimand you for disappearing...
I have the impression that I did something similar,{wait:short} once.

{name:phoenix}
So you did. So you did.

{name:edgeworth}
Indeed. Life happens,{wait:short} yes,{wait:short} and so do matters of emotion.
Then,{wait:short} you are forgiven. Now never do it again,{wait:short} do you hear me?

{name:phoenix}
Loud and clear,{wait:short} Edgeworth.

{name:gumshoe}
So what're you going to do now,{wait:short} pal?

{name:phoenix}
Honestly,{wait:short} I don't know.
I've been content with letting the winds of life carry me wheresoever they choose.

{name:gumshoe}
C'mon,{wait:short} pal! You have to do something!

{name:phoenix}
Believe me,{wait:short} I'm doing all I can. But I'm a civilian now.
I don't have access to any information related to the case.
...Well,{wait:short} besides the personal records I'm keeping.
I'm investigating thoroughly,{wait:short} but as long as I'm a civilian...
...and as long as I'm a father,{wait:short} I have other priorities.
To see Trucy smile.
I want to be "Mr. Wright,{wait:short} attorney at law" again. I really do.
But deep down,{wait:short} I know her smile is more radiant than any badge.
And her calling me "Daddy"... is the most fulfilling title I could ever hope for.

{name:gumshoe}
Aww,{wait:short} y-you're gonna make me tear up,{wait:short} here!
*sniff* *sob* *bawl*

{name:edgeworth}
(Wright does have a point.)
Wha— Detective! Why are you looking at me like that!? Clean up those tears!
You look like a starved dog.

{name:gumshoe}
O-Oh! S-Sorry,{wait:short} s-sir!

{name:phoenix}
The good detective must want you to pull in a favor for me.

{name:edgeworth}
I figured as much. You can rest easy,{wait:short} Detective.
I already planned to reopen the investigation.
I'm unsure if any new information will surface,{wait:short} but it's worth trying.

{name:phoenix}
I— Thanks,{wait:short} Edgeworth.

{name:edgeworth}
No need to remain so stoic,{wait:short} Wright.

{name:phoenix}
Practice what you preach.

(The two share a laugh.)

(Fade to black.)

{name:edgeworth}
(Phoenix Wright.
I'll never know what goes on inside that head of yours.
But ever since I met you,{wait:short} I've learned that things have a way of working out for the best.
Hopefully,{wait:short} once this nightmare is over,{wait:short} we'll be able to do battle in court again.)
