A ha ha,{wait:short} yes.{wait:normal}{newLine}

That's the truth,{wait:short} Edgeworth.{textboxEnd}

Wright,{wait:short} it's been nearly three{newLine}
years since that trial.{textboxEnd}
I've known of your{newLine}

{charAnimation:phoenixStraightLook}
{name:phoenix}
Yes,{wait:short} Edgeworth.{wait:normal} You have.{wait:normal}{newLine}
But that's just it.{textboxEnd}
{charAnimation:phoenixHeadDown}
I've spent the past three years{newLine}
struggling to raise a daughter.{textboxEnd}
{charAnimation:phoenixSideLook}
With a little help,{wait:short} I've kept{newLine}
the lights on and Trucy fed.{wait:normal}{newLine}
But it hasn't been easy.{textboxEnd}
{charAnimation:phoenixHeadDown}
It...{wait:normal} was devastating walking{newLine}
around town every day,{wait:short} seeing{newLine}
people who looked up to me.{textboxEnd}
{charAnimation:phoenixHeadDown}
Quickly,{wait:short} rumors broke out.{wait:normal} Small things{newLine}
at first.{textboxEnd}
Yet there was enough truth in{newLine}
them that every gaze stung.{textboxEnd}
{charAnimation:phoenixHeadDown}
And eventually I...{wait:normal}{newLine}
I ditched the blue suit,{wait:short} buried that{newLine}
part of myself inside.{textboxEnd}
{name:edgeworth}
...{wait:normal}{newLine}
{textColor:blue}(I don't know what to say.){textboxEnd}{textColor:white}
{charAnimation:phoenixStraightLook}
{name:phoenix}
Once people stopped recognizing{newLine}
me,{wait:short} I was free.{textboxEnd}
{charAnimation:phoenixHeadDown}
So be it,{wait:short} if that was{newLine}
the price to cast off the{newLine}
chains of my past.{textboxEnd}
{name:edgeworth}
{textColor:blue}(The chains of his past...){textboxEnd}{textColor:white}
{charAnimation:phoenixStraightLook}
{name:phoenix}
That's the truth.{wait:normal}{newLine}
I'm doing everything I can,{wait:short}{newLine}
every night,{wait:short} every day.{textboxEnd}
{charAnimation:phoenixStraightLook}
But I'm not "Mr. Wright"{newLine}
anymore.{wait:normal} Just "Phoenix."{textboxEnd}
{charAnimation:phoenixStraightLook}
An ordinary guy,{wait:short} like he{newLine}
always was...{textboxEnd}
{charAnimation:phoenixHeadDown}
And now one who can barely{newLine}
even protect his own daughter.{textboxEnd}
{charAnimation:phoenixHeadDown}
What kind of life am I leading?{textboxEnd}
{charAnimation:phoenixHeadDown}
Sure,{wait:short} you know "of" my{newLine}
disbarment.{wait:normal} But you'll never,{wait:short}{newLine}
{charAnimation:phoenixGlaring} ever know "about" it.{textboxEnd}
{name:edgeworth}
W-Wright,{wait:short} I...{wait:normal}{newLine}
I had no idea.{textboxEnd}
{charAnimation:phoenixHeadDown}
{name:phoenix}
I'm...{wait:normal} I'm sorry.{textboxEnd}
{charAnimation:phoenixHeadDown}
It all came out,{wait:short} all of{newLine}

"If only I could do more."{textboxEnd}
{charAnimation:phoenixHeadDown}
Of "If only I could protect{newLine}
those I love."{textboxEnd}
{charAnimation:phoenixHeadDown}
"If only I could be me."{textboxEnd}
{charAnimation:phoenixSmiling}
I meant what I said...{wait:normal}{newLine}
but you have to understand,{wait:short}{newLine}
I also didn't.{textboxEnd}
{spriteFade:out}
{charAnimation:gumshoeSmiling}
{spriteFade:in}
{name:gumshoe}
It's alright.{wait:normal} No problem,{wait:short} pal!{textboxEnd}

Very well,{wait:short} Wright.{wait:normal}{newLine}
I understand.{textboxEnd}
While it is true that I am{newLine}
tempted to reprimand you{newLine}
for disappearing...{textboxEnd}
I have the impression that I{newLine}
did something similar,{wait:short} once.{textboxEnd}
{spriteFade:out}
{charAnimation:phoenixSideLook}
{spriteFade:in}
{name:phoenix}
...So you did, Edgeworth.{wait:normal}{newLine}
So you did.{textboxEnd}
{name:edgeworth}
Indeed.{wait:normal} Life happens,{wait:short} yes,{wait:short} and{newLine}
so do matters of emotion.{textboxEnd}
Then,{wait:short} you are forgiven. Now{newLine}
never do it again,{wait:short} do{newLine}
you hear me?{textboxEnd}

Loud and clear.{textboxEnd}

do now,{wait:short} pal?{textboxEnd}

{charAnimation:phoenixNormal}
{spriteFade:in}
{name:phoenix}
Honestly,{wait:short} I don't know.{textboxEnd}

{spriteFade:out}

{spriteFade:out}
{charAnimation:phoenixHeadDown}

{name:phoenix}
Believe me,{wait:short} I'm doing all I{newLine}
can.{wait:normal} But I'm a civilian now.{textboxEnd}

I don't have access to any{newLine}
information related to the case.{textboxEnd}
{charAnimation:phoenixSideLook}
...{wait:normal}Well,{wait:short} besides the personal{newLine}
records I'm keeping.{textboxEnd}
{charAnimation:phoenixNormal}
I'm investigating,{wait:short} but as long{newLine}
as I'm a civilian...{textboxEnd}
And as long as I'm a{newLine}
{charAnimation:phoenixSmiling}father,{wait:short} I have{newLine}
other priorities.{textboxEnd}
{charAnimation:phoenixSmiling}To see Trucy smile.{textboxEnd}
{charAnimation:phoenixHeadDown}
I want to be "Mr. Wright,{wait:short}{newLine}
attorney{newLine} at law" again.{wait:normal}{newLine}
I really do.{textboxEnd}
{charAnimation:phoenixNormal}
But from deep down to up top,{wait:short} I{newLine}
{charAnimation:phoenixSmiling}know her smile is more radiant{newLine}
than any badge.{textboxEnd}
{charAnimation:phoenixHeadDown}

{charAnimation:phoenixSmiling}is the most fulfilling title{newLine}
I could ever hope for.{textboxEnd}

For I've found a fatal flaw{newLine}
in your reasoning.{textboxEnd}
{charAnimation:phoenixSideLook}
{name:phoenix}
Huh?{wait:normal} What reasoning?{textboxEnd}
{name:edgeworth}
You stated that I will "never,{wait:short}{newLine}

going through.{textboxEnd}
{charAnimation:phoenixSmiling}
{name:phoenix}
Yeah,{wait:short} sorry about that one.{textboxEnd}
{name:edgeworth}
It may be so.{wait:normal} However, if you'd{newLine}
given it an ounce of thought...{textboxEnd}
...you would see that you{newLine}

I too walk under the weight{newLine}

slipped my mind.{textboxEnd}

Listen here,{wait:short} Wright.{textboxEnd}
