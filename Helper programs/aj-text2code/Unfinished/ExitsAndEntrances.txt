(I can't believe it...{wait:normal}{newLine}
Vera,{wait:short} poisoned right in front{newLine}
of our eyes...!){textboxEnd}
(And the "Devil"...{wait:normal} if only{newLine}
we knew who they were.){textboxEnd}
(The medics diagnosed her with{newLine}
acute poisoning and rushed{newLine}
her away.){textboxEnd}

(Everything is deathly still,{wait:short}{newLine}

(And Trucy...{wait:normal} she's just a{newLine}
little kid,{wait:short} after all,{wait:short}{newLine}
I guess.){textboxEnd}
(She's wrapped around me so{newLine}

Trucy...{wait:normal} if it's okay,{wait:short} could you{newLine}
let go just a little bit?{textboxEnd}
Otherwise I'm going to wake{newLine}
up tomorrow all black and blue.{textboxEnd}

{name:trucy}
{sound:shock}Ah!{textboxEnd}

(My suit is damp where her{newLine}

Vera's going to be just fine.{wait:normal}{newLine}
I--{textboxEnd}{textColor:blue}
(...{wait:normal}If I lie,{wait:short} she could tell.){textboxEnd}{textColor:white}
I...{wait:normal} think.{textboxEnd}

(Nervous tics from head to{newLine}

(...{wait:normal}For her own sake,{wait:short} and for{newLine}

(It makes me feel even more{newLine}

But *sniff* don't push yourself{newLine}
too hard,{wait:short} got it?{textboxEnd}

{sound:ding}OK!{textboxEnd}
Now then,{wait:short} Apollo!{wait:normal}{newLine}
We need to do something!{wait:normal}{newLine}
For Vera!{textboxEnd}
Case this joint!{wait:normal} Inspect every{newLine}

we can't.{textboxEnd}
The courtroom is taped off{newLine}

poisoning.{textboxEnd}

{name:trucy}
So what,{wait:short} we're going to sit{newLine}
here and idle until the{newLine}

(Apollo's phone rings)

{name:apollo}
...Hello?

{name:???Male}
How mundane a greeting in return for the munificent grace I impart unto you!

{name:apollo}
(...This guy. Now?)
(Look,{wait:short} if you tell me magic is involved in this case too,{wait:short} I'm disappearing.)

{name:valant}
For it is I,{wait:short} Valant,{wait:short} teleporting his voice directly from his own lips to thine own ears!
Free of charge.

{name:apollo}
(So you're going to pay my phone bill?)

{name:trucy}
Who is it?

{name:apollo}
Mr. Valant.

{name:trucy}
Whaaaaat? Put it on speaker!

{name:apollo}
Alright.

(beep sound)

{name:trucy}
Uncle Valant,{wait:short} it's me! Trucy!

{name:valant}
Miss Trucy! Of all people,{wait:short} you are the Trucy I wished not to miss.

{name:trucy}
Yippee!

{name:apollo}
(From crying to jumping for joy. And you just saw him yesterday!)
(No way this isn't an act.)
So,{wait:short} Mr. Valant,{wait:short} why are you calling? You see,{wait:short} it's really not the best time...

{name:valant}
The putrid poisoning of the forger of fakes,{wait:short} that girl gilded with guilt?
Of course,{wait:short} this all Valant knows,{wait:short} for Valant knows all.
I watched the news.

{name:apollo}
(Very magical,{wait:short} Mr. Valant.)

{name:valant}
...I'm truly sorry to hear of it.

{name:apollo}
(I wasn't expecting such sincerity. This is new.)

{name:trucy}
Yes,{wait:short} Uncle Valant,{wait:short} it's terrible! She collapsed right in front of us!

{name:valant}
Indeed,{wait:short} 'tis tragic.
Now,{wait:short} as for why I ring...
it is that I might ring in an era of magic reborn,{wait:short} wrought by Valant's own hands.
To witness this new stage,{wait:short} I ask that you ascend to the stage,{wait:short} in the Sunshine Coliseum.

{name:trucy}
A new era of magic? And we get to see it? I can't wait!

{name:valant}
...

{name:apollo}
Mr. Valant,{wait:short} how do we get inside? Not just any average Joe can prance in.

{name:valant}
Worry your weary old heart not,{wait:short} unravel the knot beneath your navel.
I told the staff about you.

{name:apollo}
O-Old!?

{name:trucy}
We'll be there as soon as we can!
And by the time we get back,{wait:short} we'll be able to investigate the courtroom.

{name:apollo}
Er,{wait:short} Mr. Valant,{wait:short} may I ask one question?

{name:valant}
You already have.

{name:apollo}
(I'll take that as a yes.)
...How did you get my phone number?

{name:valant}
...
...
...A magician never reveals his secrets.

{name:trucy}
You're incredible,{wait:short} Uncle Valant!

{name:apollo}
(...Great. Now I need to redo all my passwords.)

(fade to black,{wait:short} then fade in inside the Coliseum hallway)


{name:???Male}
Well met,{wait:short} and welcome!

{name:trucy}
Uncle Valant!

(Valant appears)

{name:apollo}
Weren't we going up to the stage?

{name:valant}
Is it not a miraculous maneuver of magic to exchange expectation for the exhilerating and exotic?
The door was locked.

{name:trucy}
I can open the door for you,{wait:short} Uncle Valant.

{name:apollo}
(Reminder: never trust Trucy around locks.)

{name:valant}
It is unnecessary.

{name:trucy}
So,{wait:short} what's this new era of magic you were talking about,{wait:short} Uncle Valant?

{name:valant}
...

{name:apollo}
(He looks... sad,{wait:short} somehow.)

{name:valant}
In this hallway where we after seven years met,{wait:short} Miss Trucy...
I shall haul away my hallowed hoard and grant it... to you.

{name:apollo}
You're giving her money? Because she pays my salary,{wait:short} so I'd really appreciate that.

{name:trucy}
Polly,{wait:short} shush!

{name:valant}
I bequeath nothing so trivial,{wait:short} nothing so mean.
But that I entrust my future to you,{wait:short} Miss Trucy,{wait:short} I mean.

{name:trucy}
...What?

{name:valant}
Recall my show happening in two days.
Now forget it. For I have canceled it.

{name:trucy}
...

{name:apollo}
W-What? Why?
(She looks like she's in shock...)

{name:valant}
Because I'm turning myself in to the police.

{name:apollo}
...

{name:trucy}
...

{name:valant}
Long ago,{wait:short} I committed a crime more treacherous than murder.
Yes... Miss Trucy,{wait:short} I am the reason your father needed to vanish.

{name:trucy}
That trial back then... you...?

{name:apollo}
Trial? What trial?

{name:trucy}
...I know you're kidding,{wait:short} Uncle Valant.

{name:valant}
Sadly,{wait:short} Miss Trucy,{wait:short} it is true,{wait:short} you must see.

{name:trucy}
Without you,{wait:short} Daddy would still be here...?

{name:valant}
I can't deny it. I don't deserve to apologize,{wait:short} but I apologize nevertheless.

{name:trucy}
...

{name:valant}
I trust you will hear the story in due course.
So,{wait:short} of course,{wait:short} I must do what is due:
Repent,{wait:short} however I may -- vanish into prison,{wait:short} until a future day.
The new era of magic I envision... is a stage with me nowhere in sight.
With you,{wait:short} dazzling on-site.
...You're the next Gramarye,{wait:short} after all!

{name:trucy}
...!
...
...

{name:apollo}
(This jerk...!)
Look,{wait:short} Mr. Valant. I have no idea what you're talking about.
This trial,{wait:short} or your crime,{wait:short} or your history,{wait:short} or whatever.
If you commit a crime,{wait:short} you need to turn yourself in.
That's just how it works.
But dropping all of this on Trucy out of the blue?
I don't care if you're some accomplished,{wait:short} hotshot magician.
Look at her! She's frozen!

{name:valant}
My business is not with you.
I merely called you as a means to contact Miss Trucy.

{name:apollo}
So what? I'm here now,{wait:short} and you have to deal with it.
All the world's a stage,{wait:short} but not your stage. You're a player too!
Refusing to talk about your illusion during a murder investigation...
Trying to open Trucy's envelope...
Doing whatever you're doing right now!
Try using that magic of yours to think about somebody else for once!

{name:valant}
...

{name:apollo}
(I... I just went off on him. I almost can't believe it.)
(But when I saw Trucy like that,{wait:short} I acted without thinking.)

{name:trucy}
...Thank you,{wait:short} Apollo. I appreciate it,{wait:short} really.

{name:valant}
Miss Trucy?

{name:trucy}
...
...You're one of Daddy's best friends,{wait:short} Uncle Valant.

{name:valant}
...Indeed.

{name:trucy}
And you're an incredible magician! I always wanted to be your assistant.
So I trusted you.

{name:valant}
!

{name:trucy}
But it seems like... that trust was your most powerful illusion of all.
...

{name:valant}
Once more,{wait:short} I apologize,{wait:short} as prodigiously and profusely as I can.
I didn't mean to upset you,{wait:short} Miss Trucy.
I only wished to secure the future of our treasured Troupe Gramarye.

{name:trucy}
...

{name:apollo}
Do you realize what you're doing,{wait:short} using her to assuage your own guilt?
Passing your legacy onto her to convince yourself you're not a failure?
You're just going to decide her life for her,{wait:short} just like that!?

{name:trucy}
Apollo...

{name:valant}
As I said,{wait:short} and as I reluctantly repeat:
"I only wished to secure the future of our treasured Troupe Gramarye."
Deciding her life,{wait:short} I have done nothing of the sort.

{name:trucy}
So... you never trusted me,{wait:short} did you?

{name:valant}
What do you mean,{wait:short} Miss Trucy?

{name:trucy}
If you had,{wait:short} you would've already known...
I would never let Troupe Gramarye fade away.
Troupe Gramarye is my family. My first home.
It's me.

{name:valant}
I only thought to bid you farewell on your journey before turning myself in.
Nor,{wait:short} Miss Trucy,{wait:short} did I aim to afflict you with anathema through my absence.
For once I return,{wait:short} I will return to magic.
My status as a Grand Magician doubtlessly diminished,{wait:short} my reputation ruined...
I will return to the stage. Of this,{wait:short} you can be certain.
Perhaps,{wait:short} fickle Fate's tables turned,{wait:short} I will become your assistant!
Ah ha ha ha ha ha!

{name:apollo}
(Can I deck him? Can I call Clay over so we can both deck him?)

{name:trucy}
...Uncle Valant. You don't get it.
All the world wanted... all we wanted... was you!
Your magic. Your wonder. The smiles you brought to our faces.
Not your status. Not your fame. That's not what Troupe Gramarye is about.

{name:apollo}
(She's quiet,{wait:short} almost whispering,{wait:short} but her voice commands attention.)

{name:trucy}
And now you tell me that you're the reason Daddy disappeared...
And the reason my other Daddy has suffered ever since that trial.
That you're turning yourself in for who knows who long.
...
I'm done.
I'm done!
I'm done! I'm done with people disappearing on me!
Vera... D-Daddy... You. I'm done.
You hear me? I'm done!

(fade to black,{wait:short} then fade back in to represent a minute passing)


Valant (now sad):
I am Valant Gramarye,{wait:short} he who suffers no mystery not grasped tightly twixt his fingers.
Yet when I arrived to meet you on the stage,{wait:short} for my final performance...
The door was locked.
The door should've been open! It was supposed to be open!
The staff told me it'd be open!
And nothing -- nothing! -- in my Grand Grimoire of magical mastery could open it.

{name:apollo}
(He's behaving like a completely different person.)

{name:valant}
Mr. Justice.

{name:apollo}
(Huh? He knows my name?)

{name:valant}
You are correct. I realize now more than ever.
I am a failure,{wait:short} verily void of virtuosity.

{name:apollo}
...That's not true,{wait:short} Mr. Valant. You're a jerk,{wait:short} but that's just not true.
I've seen your magic. It's incredible.

{name:valant}
Ah ha ha ha ha.
I'd expect nothing less from Mr. Wright's apprentice.

{name:apollo}
(Drop the "apprentice" part and I'll reconsider decking you.)

{name:valant}
...Recently,{wait:short} I decided that I'd never again live life in thrall to the dead.
And yet here I am,{wait:short} Miss Trucy,{wait:short} forcing you under the thrall of the living.

{name:trucy}
I'm going to do it. Keep Troupe Gramarye alive in everyone's hearts.
Not for you. Not for Daddy. Not for Troupe Gramarye.
Because this is the path that I,{wait:short} Trucy Wright,{wait:short} Magician Extraordinaire,{wait:short} choose.
My journey is set. If the door is closed,{wait:short} I'll open it.
And you,{wait:short} Uncle Valant... it's time for you to step into the audience.

{name:valant}
...!

{name:trucy}
I'll visit you... one day.
And I'll be a better magician than you ever were.

{name:valant}
Yes,{wait:short} you will,{wait:short} Miss Trucy. I'm certain of it.
...It seems that trust,{wait:short} unlike so many pieces of paper,{wait:short} cannot be as easily reformed.
But before I betake myself,{wait:short} let it be known...
...That in my bosom now blossoms a blessed belief:
"Is it not the most miraculous maneuver of magic to face forward?"
For the first time,{wait:short} with your aid,{wait:short} I behold the stage... and I'm filled with pride.
Miss Trucy. Mr. Justice.
...
Until we meet again.


(Fade to black)

(And so Valant slowly spun and vanished from sight.)
(No sooner had all traces of yellow disappeared than I got hit by a truck.)
(And this time...)
(I don't care if my whole body becomes black and blue.)
(Because I was crying too.)
(All the panic of Vera's poisoning,{wait:short} and the stress of the day yet to come...)
(All the hopelessness,{wait:short} all the struggling with the past I'd witnessed since April.)
(The dam burst,{wait:short} and in that moment... I was thankful Trucy was my friend.)
(And two players on a stage,{wait:short} we turned towards the exit.)
