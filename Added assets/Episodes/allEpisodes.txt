It's not exactly the same.{newLine}

The difference is I'm{newLine}

{textSpeed:A}...{textSpeed:3}{textboxEnd}
{music:detentionCenter2001}
{name:phoenix}
{charAnimation:phoenixNormal}
I used forged evidence,{wait:short}{newLine}
or tried to,{wait:short} and it{newLine}
cost me my badge.{textboxEnd}
{charAnimation:phoenixHeadDown}
One-and-done,{wait:short} no appeals.{textboxEnd}
{name:ema}
...{wait:normal}{textboxEnd}
I'll throw you a bone{newLine}
and pretend I buy that{newLine}
you'd do that.{wait:normal} {sound:realization}Why?{textboxEnd}
{name:phoenix}
{charAnimation:phoenixNormal}
I was arrogant.{wait:normal} I thought{newLine}
I had it all worked out,{wait:short}{newLine}
and I got cocky.{textboxEnd}
{name:ema}
That's...{wait:normal} the opposite of{newLine}
an explanation.{wait:normal} It{newLine}
doesn't answer anything.{textboxEnd}
{name:phoenix}
{charAnimation:phoenixGlaring}
Does it matter,{wait:short} Ema?{textboxEnd}
{name:ema}
{sound:ding}!{wait:normal}{newLine}
Does it--{wait:normal}... o-of {shake:1}{sound:punctuate}course it{newLine}
matters!{textboxEnd}
{charAnimation:phoenixHeadDownS}
{textSpeed:2}You're {shake:1}{sound:punctuate}supposed to be Phoenix{shake:1}{sound:punctuate}{newLine}

You...{wait:normal} you help people when{newLine}
they have no one else{newLine}
to turn to!{textboxEnd}
{name:phoenix}
{charAnimation:phoenixHeadDown}
That was then,{wait:short} Ema.{wait:normal}{newLine}
Things change.{textboxEnd}
{name:ema}
{textSpeed:2}That doesn't mean {shake:1}{sound:punctuate}you had to!{textSpeed:3}{textboxEnd}
So they decided that your{newLine}
evidence was a forgery,{wait:short}{newLine}
and you just--{wait:20}{textboxEndForced}
{name:phoenix}
{charAnimation:phoenixGlaring}
Ema.{wait:normal}{wait:normal}{newLine}
{charAnimation:phoenixHeadDown}
It WAS a forgery.{textboxEnd}
{charAnimation:phoenixHeadDown}
You can go ahead and keep{newLine}
not believing that,{wait:short} but{newLine}
it won't change {shake:0}anything.{textboxEnd}
{charAnimation:phoenixNormal}
It happened,{wait:short} and if you{newLine}
want to know why I'm{newLine}
not a lawyer anymore...{wait:normal}{textboxEnd}
{charAnimation:phoenixNormal}
...That IS the answer{newLine}
you're after.{textboxEnd}

I don't even want to{newLine}
hear it.{textboxEnd}
{sound:punctuate}Maybe you've just decided{newLine}
that closing up is fine.{textboxEnd}
{sound:punctuate}That refusing to tell{newLine}
anyone anything like this{newLine}
is fine.{textboxEnd}
{sound:punctuate}That I should just{newLine}

{textSpeed:4}It sure wouldn't be the{newLine}

{name:ema}
No.{wait:normal}{newLine}

{charAnimation:phoenixHeadDown}
Well,{wait:short} glad she's{newLine}

{charAnimation:phoenixHeadDown}
...{wait:normal}{newLine}
Look,{wait:short} I wish I'd done more{newLine}
to keep in touch.{textboxEnd}
{charAnimation:phoenixHeadDown}
You deserved that.{wait:normal} {charAnimation:phoenixSideLook}That being{newLine}

{name:ema}
{sound:damage}!{wait:normal}{textboxEnd}
...{wait:normal} *sigh* {textSpeed:5}I could've at least{newLine}
checked in often enough to{newLine}
find out you had a daughter.{textboxEnd}{textSpeed:3}
{name:phoenix}
{charAnimation:phoenixWideEyed}
I'm glad you could meet{newLine}
her.{wait:normal} She really changed{newLine}
everything for me.{textboxEnd}

{sound:shock}
{wait:3B}

Oh,{wait:short} don't give me that{newLine}
look.{wait:normal} Adopted,{wait:short} it's obvious.{wait:normal}{newLine}
When?{textboxEnd}
{name:phoenix}
{charAnimation:phoenixLaughing}{wait:62}
{charAnimation:phoenixSmiling}
Actually,{sound:ding}{wait:short} it wasn't long after{newLine}
you headed back to Europe.{textboxEnd}

{textSpeed:2}Wait,{wait:short}{sound:shock} really?{textboxEnd}{textSpeed:3}

(God,{wait:short} was that the first{newLine}

I came in here?){textboxEnd}{textColor:white}

My last client.{wait:normal} He wasn't{newLine}
what you'd call model{newLine}

{music:investigationCore}
{shake:0}You're raising your old{newLine}

That's the story.{wait:normal} When things{newLine}
weren't looking so good for{newLine}
him in the trial,{wait:short} he bailed.{textboxEnd}
{charAnimation:phoenixHeadDown}
{textSpeed:5}...{wait:normal}Left his kid behind{newLine}
with me.{textSpeed:3}{textboxEnd}
{name:ema}
{textSpeed:2}{shock}Just like that?{textSpeed:3} Didn't{newLine}
the police find him?{textboxEnd}
{name:phoenix}
{charAnimation:phoenixHeadDown}
Disappearing was a...{wait:normal}{charAnimation:phoenixNormal}{newLine}
well-trained skill of his.{textboxEnd}
{name:ema}
...{wait:normal}{sound:shock}{shake:0}Wait,{wait:short} so...{wait:normal} he was your{newLine}
client in the same case{newLine}
where you lost your badge?{textboxEnd}
{name:phoenix}
{charAnimation:phoenixNormal}
That's right.{textboxEnd}
{charAnimation:phoenixSideLook}
Since I get the feeling you're{newLine}
going to ask,{wait:short} no.{sound:ding}{textboxEnd}
{charAnimation:phoenixSideLook}
He didn't have anything{newLine}
to do with the forged{newLine}
evidence.{textboxEnd}

(And we're back to that.{wait:normal}{newLine}
Great.){textboxEnd}{textColor:white}
...Wow.{wait:normal} That's...{wait:normal} a hell of{newLine}
a lot to unpack at once.{textboxEnd}
So...{wait:normal} you really tried{newLine}
to use forged evidence.{textboxEnd}
{name:phoenix}
{charAnimation:phoenixHeadDown}
I don't see a point in{newLine}
denying that.{textboxEnd}
{name:ema}
{textColor:blue}
(...{wait:normal}Hold on.){textboxEnd}
{textColor:white}
{textSpeed:5}Mr. Wright,{wait:short} you haven't said{newLine}
once that {sound:realization}{textColor:red}you actually forged{newLine}
anything{textColor:white}.{textSpeed:3}{textboxEnd}
Just that there {sound:ding}WAS{newLine}
forged evidence,{wait:short} and that{newLine}
you used it.{textboxEnd}
{name:phoenix}
{textSpeed:A}...{textSpeed:3}{textboxEnd}
{name:ema}
{sound:shock}You didn't know,{wait:short} did you?{newLine}
When you presented{newLine}
the evidence.{textboxEnd}
You thought it was{newLine}
legitimate.{textboxEnd}
{name:phoenix}
{textSpeed:A}...{textSpeed:3}{textboxEnd}
{name:ema}
I'm right.{wait:normal}{newLine}
Why didn't you just{newLine}
say that?{textboxEnd}
{sound:ding}It's the same thing{newLine}
that happened to{newLine}
Mr. Edgeworth back then!{textboxEnd}
{name:phoenix}
{textbox:hide}
{wait:3B}
{textbox:show}
{charAnimation:phoenixNormal}
Sharp as anything.{wait:normal} You know,{wait:short}{newLine}
it's a crime they didn't{newLine}
let you into forensics.{textboxEnd}

(So...{wait:normal} that's what really{newLine}
happened.{wait:normal} Mr. Wright...{musicFade:10}){textColor:white}{textboxEnd}
It's no wonder Apollo{newLine}

about you...{wait:normal}{textboxEnd}
...if you've taken this{newLine}

want to {shake:1}shake you until{newLine}
some actual answers fall out.{textboxEnd}
{name:phoenix}
{charAnimation:phoenixLaughing}{wait:62}
{charAnimation:phoenixSmiling}
{sound:ding}Maybe another time.{textboxEnd}
{charAnimation:phoenixSmiling}
Right now,{wait:short} what do you say{newLine}
to getting something{newLine}
to eat?{textboxEnd}
{charAnimation:phoenixNormal}
There's this noodle cart{newLine}
nearby,{wait:short} you won't{newLine}
believe it.{textboxEnd}
{name:ema}
{textSpeed:5}Wait,{wait:short}{textSpeed:3} you {shake:0}don't mean--...?{textboxEnd}
{name:phoenix}
{charAnimation:phoenixNormal}

Mr. Wright wasn't exactly{newLine}

(...{wait:normal}Well,{wait:short} almost.{wait:normal} Not really.{wait:normal}{newLine}
